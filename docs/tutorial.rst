How to Add Your Jupyter Notebook Example
========================================

Please ensure that your notebook is well-formatted for documentation and
reproducible by others.

Finalizing your notebook
------------------------

Follow these steps to keep your notebook clean, structured, and
functional:

1. Ensure you are using relative file paths.

- Example: ``ds_nazare = xr.open_dataset('/data/s2_nazare.nc')``
- Avoid something like
  ``ds_nazare = xr.open_dataset('C:/Users/your_name/ray_tracing/notebooks/your_folder/data/s2_nazare.nc')``

2. Include required data.

- If your example requires generated data, include the code that creates
  it.
- Include actual data files in a ``data/`` folder within your example
  directory.
- Do not include synthetic data files.

3. Refactor helper functions.

- Move non-essential functions to a ``support.py`` file in your
  subfolder.
- Keep function definitions in the notebook if their implementation is
  meaningful to the example.

4. Remove unnecessary code and output.

- Remove print statements used for debugging unless they add value.
- Delete commented-out code unless it serves as a meaningful
  explanation.
- Delete any unused cells.

5. Present output in a clear and readable format.

- Use tables, formatted strings, or labeled figures.
- Output should be clear and understandable to the reader.

6. Ensure clear markdown organization.

- Use headers for organization (# Title, ## Section, ### Subsection).
- Include a sentence or two explanation after each header.
- Verify that markdown renders correctly, especially for math
  formatting.

..

   Important note: use the ``#`` header only once for the title of your
   file. If you include it multiple times, the documentation will not
   render properly.

7. Ensure code executes properly.

- (Re)Run ``pixi run -e docs develop``
- Restart the kernel and run all cells.
- Ensure all cells execute successfully in the ``docs`` environment.

8. Proper style.

- Use Ruff for formatting and linting:

::

   pixi run ruff format path/to/file
   pixi run ruff check path/to/file

- Use meaningful variable names.
- Write clear but non-redundant comments.
- Include docstrings for functions (‚Äú‚Äú‚ÄúDescription‚Äù‚Äú‚Äú).
- Check spelling and grammar in markdown, comments, and code.

Adding your example to the documentation
----------------------------------------

Now that your notebook is polished, follow these steps to include it in
the notebooks gallery:

9. Save your notebook in the right location.

- Create a subfolder inside the ``notebooks/`` directory to contain your
  example.
- Example: this file is located at
  ``notebooks/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb``.

10. Add notebook to the gallery.

- Append your notebook filename (without ``.ipynb``) to
  ``docs/gallery_header.rst``.
- Example: this notebook is ``tutorial.ipynb``, so ``tutorial`` is
  appended to ``docs/gallery_header.rst``.

..

   Important note: If a name conflict exists, rename your notebook.

11. Make sure the docs build with no error.

- Run:

::

   SPHINXOPTS="-W --keep-going -n" pixi run -e docs python-docs

- Ensure there are no errors.
- Open ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in a browser and confirm your
  notebook appears in the gallery.

12. Submit your notebook.

- If everything works, open a Pull Request (PR) to add your example! üéâ

13. Getting help.

- If you have any questions or following these instructions does not
  work, please ask!

Example Notebook
----------------

Below is an example notebook. This section of the notebook was adapted
from the shear current example, formatted using the steps above.

.. code:: ipython3

    # include imports first, in one cell
    from mantaray.core import single_ray
    import numpy as np
    import xarray as xr
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Create and display bathymetry dataset based on a step function.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Create Bathymetry
    NX = 300
    NY = 100
    dl = 50
    xs = np.arange(0, NX) * dl
    ys = np.arange(0, NY) * dl
    xss, yss = np.meshgrid(xs, ys)
    coords = xss * yss
    depth_max = 140
    d_depth = 20
    n_shelfs = 6
    depth = depth_max - np.floor(np.linspace(0, n_shelfs, NX, endpoint=False)) * d_depth
    bathymetry = depth * np.ones((len(ys), len(xs)))
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    depth = ax.contourf(xss, yss, bathymetry)
    cbar = fig.colorbar(depth)
    cbar.ax.set_ylabel("Depth [m]")
    plt.show()



.. image:: ./tutorial_4_0.png


Save bathymetry data as netcdf3 file.

.. code:: ipython3

    bathymetry_array = xr.Dataset(
        data_vars={"depth": (("y", "x"), bathymetry)},
        coords={"x": ("x", np.float64(xs)), "y": ("y", np.float64(ys))},
    )
    bathymetry_array.to_netcdf(path="bathymetry.nc", format="NETCDF3_CLASSIC")

Create null current and save it as netcdf3 file.

.. code:: ipython3

    null_current = xr.Dataset(
        data_vars={
            "u": (("x", "y"), np.zeros_like(coords).T),
            "v": (("x", "y"), np.zeros_like(coords).T),
        },
        coords={"y": ys, "x": xs},
    )
    null_current.to_netcdf(path="null_current.nc", format="NETCDF3_CLASSIC")

Define the initial ray tracing parameters for this example.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Define wave number
    k = 2 * np.pi / 20000  # lambda = 100m
    phi0 = 20 * np.pi / 180  # phi0 = 25 degrees from x axis
    kx = k * np.cos(phi0)
    ky = k * np.sin(phi0)
    omega = np.sqrt(depth_max * 9.81) * k
    
    # Define ray initial positon
    x0 = 50  # Offset from 0 by 1 step
    y0 = 500

Run ``single_ray`` to simulate your initial ray.

.. code:: ipython3

    ray_evolution_raw = single_ray(
        x0, y0, kx, ky, 1000, 0.5, bathymetry="bathymetry.nc", current="null_current.nc"
    )

and so on for the rest of your notebook ‚Ä¶
